| Data Wrangler      | Open and edit .parquet, .csv files through VS Code              |

## Terraform
We use Terraform to deploy Infrastructure as a code, [using this YAML release Pipeline.](https://dev.azure.com/is-prod/isolutions.BI/_build?definitionId=1075)

Every stage contains a resource group and storage account to store our Terraform state, as the following example:

    To work, read and edit it, you can use the drawio extension found at Visual Studio Code Extension Manager.
